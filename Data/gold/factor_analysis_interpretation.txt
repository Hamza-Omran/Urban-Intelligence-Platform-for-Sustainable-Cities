    1. wind_speed_kmh           :  0.2634
    2. rain_mm                  :  0.2171
    3. humidity                 :  0.1612
    4. avg_speed_kmh            : -0.1585
    5. accident_count           :  0.0856

KEY INSIGHTS:

1. Weather Severity Impact:
   Weather conditions (rain, wind, visibility) cluster together,
   indicating a unified 'weather severity' dimension affecting traffic.

2. Traffic Flow Dynamics:
   Vehicle count and speed form a distinct factor representing
   congestion and flow characteristics independent of weather.

3. Accident Risk Factors:
   Accident occurrences correlate with specific combinations of
   weather and traffic conditions, forming a risk assessment dimension.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR URBAN TRAFFIC PLANNING:

1. Integrated Weather Monitoring:
   Deploy unified weather severity indices for traffic management
   rather than monitoring individual weather variables separately.

2. Flow-Based Interventions:
   Design traffic control strategies based on flow stress factors
   (vehicle density and speed patterns) as distinct from weather impacts.

3. Risk-Targeted Safety Measures:
   Implement accident prevention protocols triggered by combined
   factor scores rather than single-variable thresholds.

4. Predictive Modeling:
   Use factor scores as inputs for traffic prediction models
   to reduce dimensionality and improve computational efficiency.
